-- Notes:
--  * The TEI header is not explicitly represented as AST; the Ding header is
--    used instead and to be directly translated to TEI XML.
--  * Only a subset of TEI supported, sufficient to represent the Ding.
--    * In particular, only dictionaries can be represented.
--  * Trying to adhere to TEI Lex-0.
--  * The data types' names mostly map to the respective TEI XML node names.
