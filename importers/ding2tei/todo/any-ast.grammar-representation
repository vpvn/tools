The (seemingly) simplest way is to just annotate grammar in both the Ding and
TEI AST by means of lists of single grammar annotations.

It may however be considered advantageous to at some point store a set of
grammar information in a tree, annotated to any single element that may be
annotated with grammar information.
The potential benefit of this approach lies therin, that no contradictory
grammar information can be stored.

* Note however, that in both the Ding and TEI, grammar is annotated in lists.
* Note also, that the seemingly contradictory annotation {m,f} is possible, if
  a headword can have both genders.
  * One might argue though that such annotations should be treated special
    anyways.  (to be found out how to represent in TEI)
