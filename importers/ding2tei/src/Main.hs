-- Notes:
--  * The input file should be newline terminated, even though in most cases
--    it will not matter.
--    * One might consider adding a final newline, if there is none.
--    * Alex needs terminating whitespace, since the end of input  is not
--      treated as '\n' in right context (unlike the beginning of input).
--      (The whitespace in right context is needed to differentiate different
--      kinds of slashes.)
