It would be nice to identify phrases or other non-trivial expression, such that
they may be considered examples for associated keywords, and not keywords
themselves.

? Test for supsequence match (should be delimited by whitespace or similar).
  * Potential counterexamples:
    . "etw. unterlassen {vt} [adm.] | etw. zu unterlassen haben [jur.]"
    . "Adel" ~ "niederer Adel"
    . "tongue" ~ "little tongue" ~ "ZÃ¼nglein"
  ? require a certain maximum number of words in the key unit?
  * Note that capitalization may change.
? Require a certain minimum number of words in the examined unit.
* positive signs
  ? a comma
  ? a period (at the end?)
? Consider quotes (<">, <'>)

? Which side should match?
  ? Any?
  ? Both?
  ? The side that currently is the "key"-side?
  ? The side that currently is the "value"-side?

Obstacles
 * plural form / form of different gender (m/f)
   * Simple heuristics should do.
 * Inflected verbs
   * Note: Ideally, a lot of inflected forms are to be imprted from the
           Wiktionary in the future.  (There is ongoing work from Karl Bartel.)
     * This would however be accessible in TEI, so t is either to be parsed
       separately or merged post translation.
   * Note: Sometimes inflected forms are listed individually.  (TODO)
   * Some regular forms could likely be caught with a heuristic.
     * Unsure, if worth the effort.
   ? Ignore?
   * special Ex.: "ausreizen" ~ "... reizt ... aus ..."

 * Plural forms
   * Take care not to match "Menschen" as an example for "Mensch".


Some examples:
 > Angeklagte {m,f}; Angeklagter [jur.] | Angeklagten {pl}; Angeklagte | Hauptangeklagter; Erstangeklagter | Zweitangeklagter | "Angeklagter!" | anonymer Angeklagter oder anonymes Opfer (in einer Anklageschrift) | anonyme Angeklagte oder anonymes Opfer (in einer Anklageschrift) :: accused; defendant | the accused (persons/parties); defendants | primary accused | second defendant; second accused | "Prisoner at the bar!" | (the person of) John Doe (in a bill of indictment) [Am.] | (the person of) Jane Doe (in a bill of indictment) [Am.]
   * "anonyme Angeklagte oder anonymes Opfer" vs "Jane Doe"
     * the first is likely to be considered an example, the latter not.
   * "accused" ~ "the accused"
     * Is that an example?
     ? Be conservative in such cases?
