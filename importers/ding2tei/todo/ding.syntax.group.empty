Empty groups
============

Such do exist.  Probably not intentionally.

Differentiate three cases (of the corresponding other language's group)
 a) empty
    -> Drop.
 b) a phrase
    -> keep as example without translation
 c) a headword
    ? Drop?
      ? Referencing from other words on the same side of the same line?
        . No ID available to reference to.
        . The same may be the case for <~>-references.
    ? Keep without any translation?
