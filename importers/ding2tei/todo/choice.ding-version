Choose Ding version  (1.8.1 vs. devel)
 - or allow both
   - split preprocess/*.sed files

Some words have disappeared in the devel version of the Ding
- ex.: "Aggregationsreagenz" (and surrounding)
- The web version of the Ding seems to be based on a third version of the Ding
  - has "Aggregationsreagens" (final "s", not "z")
