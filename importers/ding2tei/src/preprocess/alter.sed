# TODO: This does not catch "ppron pl" in grouped annotations (\{.*[,;/].*\}).
#       (where it does not occur, in the version 1.8.1 of the Ding).
#       This would possibly better be handled in the parser.
s`\{(ppron) (pl)\}`\{\1; \2\}`g

# {relativ} is not an indpendent annotation.
# Assimilate, with {pron interrog} in mind.
# Note: It can be assumed that both below parts never occcur in (separate)
#       groups when belonging to one another (since then their relation would
#       not be obvious).

## [.or.] -> [./.]
# Notes:
#  * Cannot be generalized (as of now (2020-09-03), since [.] may contain free
#    text.
#  * Delegating to parser is generally possible, however requires splitting by
#    whitespace in the lexer.
#    * Which causes some (solvable) problems.
