Join identical headwords
========================

When a word w occurs in several lines or groups in a line, the final TEI XML
should probably hold all definitions in on place, in several `<gramGrp>`s.

If the units in a group are not considered synonyms (generally), one might
also want to separate those into `<gramGrp>`s.
