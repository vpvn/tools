Ex.: "sein {vi} | seiend | gewesen | ich bin | ..."
 - "ich bin": identify prefix
 - participles: difficult (unless maybe for regular verbs)
   - TODO: investigate further

Ex.: "to be {...} | ... | you are; you're"
 - problem: "you're"
 - solution: retain original, but additionally extract inflected forms.
   - i.e.: "be | you are; you're" -> "be" (infl: "are") | "you are; you're"
